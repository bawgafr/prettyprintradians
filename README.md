# prettyprintradians
A package to pretty print radians so that they are easier to read

Dunno if this is going to work, but the idea is that instead of seeing a long decimal number you can pretty print it and get back something like 4Ï€/3

It obviously won't be exhaustively done, nor will it be 100% accurate (float64 being a nightmare to store decimals, let along multiples of Pi....)
